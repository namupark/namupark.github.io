I'm a M.S. student at Yonsei University, Department of Digital Analytics advised by Prof. [Min Song](http://informatics.yonsei.ac.kr/tsmm/minsong.html). I will be obtaining my master's degree this summer and I am looking for my Ph.D. advisor.

As an undergraduate student, I majored in Convergence Software, Economics, and French Language & Culture. Studying three different majors helped me investigate everything from various perspectives, which allowed me to participate in research projects from distinct fields.

I have a broad research interest area in data science and computer science, especially **machine learning** and **natural language processing** (NLP). I had the great opportunity to participate in diverse projects related to NLP, and currently, I am working on **information retrieval** tasks in narrative patient reports and electronic health records (EHRs). I also worked on **signal processing** research projects, the purpose of which was to classify steering gear noises from a vehicle.

Having been working on projects with [Asan Medical Center](http://eng.amc.seoul.kr/gb/lang/main.do) for over half a year, which is the most renowned medical center in Korea, I felt the necessity for data scientists focusing on the field of biomedical informatics, especially dealing with clinical issues. In other words, I acknowledged that proper machine learning techniques and data scientific approaches are needed to stimulate the efficient use of data related to health. 

I am currently working as a researcher at Asan Medical Center and focusing on solving diverse issues related to the usage of biomedical data. I believe that this experience would be a great asset for my future studies in the field of biomedical informatics and biomedical data science.

My future goal is to contribute to the **effective use of medical data**, which will eventually help not only medical experts but also patients needing accurate diagnoses. I would like to become **a data scientist with affluent knowledge in the biomedical domain**
