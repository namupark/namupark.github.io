Hello! My name is Saurabh Garg and I am a first year PhD student at Machine Learning Department at CMU where I am advised by [Prof. Zachary Lipton](http://zacklipton.com/) and [Prof. Zico Kolter](http://zicokolter.com). I graduated from IIT Bombay, India with major and honors in Computer Science and Engineering and minors in Applied Statitics and Informatics in 2018. My Research Interests broadly lie in the field of Statistical and Robust Machine Learning. I spent one amazing year at Samsung Headquaters, Korea.

In the past, I have worked with [Prof. Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash) on building Statistical Machine Learning algorithms for exact MCMC samspling as a part of my Bachelor's thesis. During my stay at IITB, I have also spent major time working with [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi) on the problem of builing robust langauge models for code switched speech. During Summer 2018, I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen) on Question Answering using KG and corpus. 


During Summer 2017, I did a internship at Samsung Electronics HQ, Korea. Previously, I interned at the Purdue University, US where I worked with [Prof. Alex Pothen](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/apothen/) on designing approximation algorithms for weighted b-Matching.
