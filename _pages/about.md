I'm a M.S. student at Yonsei University, Department of Digital Analytics advised by Prof. [Min Song](http://informatics.yonsei.ac.kr/tsmm/minsong.html). I will be obtaining my master's degree this summer and I am looking for my Ph.D. advisor.

As an undergraduate student, I majored in Convergence Software, Economics, and French Language & Culture. Studying three different majors helped me investigate everything from various perspectives, which allowed me to participate in research projects from distinct fields.

I have a broad research interest area in computer science, especially **machine learning**. I had the great opportunity to participate in diverse projects related to **natural language processing** , and currently, I am working on some information retrieval in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). I also worked on **signal processing** research projects, the purpose of which was to classify certain noises from a vehicle.

Working as a re[Asan Medical Center](http://eng.amc.seoul.kr/gb/lang/main.do) for over a half a year, which is the most renowned medical center in Korea , I felt the necessity for data scientists focusing on Electronic Health Records, especially text data. In other words, I acknowledged that proper machine learning techniques and data scientific approach are needed to stimulate the efficient use of these data. 

Therefore, my future goal is to contribute to the **effective use of medical data**, which will eventually help not only medical experts, but also patients needing accurate diagnoses.
