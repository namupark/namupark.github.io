I'm a M.S. student at Yonsei University, department of Digital Analytics advised by Prof. [Min Song](http://informatics.yonsei.ac.kr/tsmm/minsong.html). I will be obtaining my master's degree this summer and I am looking for my Ph.D. advisor.

As an undergraduate student, I majored in French Language & Culture, Economics and Convergence Software. Studying in three different domains helped me investigate each phenomena from various perspectives and it could be one of my strengths.

I have a broad research interest areas in computer science, especially **machine learning**. I had the great opportunity to be a part of some projects related to **natural language processing** such as machine translation, and currently, I am working on some information retrieval in Electronic Health Records (EHR). I also worked on **signal processing** research projects, the purpose of which was to classify certain noises from a vehicle.

In a word, my main research area would be **deep representation learning**, which is a term that puts together all the things mentioned above. I am interested in learning the best possible representation of a certain data, which includes text (document), audio, image and so on. Triplet (Quadruplet) network is the main metric I am focusing on these days.
